# Host Info check documentation

## What are hostinfo checks?

Host information checks are a special class of checks that are used to fetch data on demand.   
The normal checks at root/checks are tied to the larger Rackspace monitoring eco-systems alarming and alerting  
features and are automatically scheduled.  
The hostinfo checks are not.  
Currently it is not possible to configure alarms and alerts via the various frontends for them.  

## Why hostinfo checks?

So what are they good for?  
They're great for fetching data on demand.  
Which is great if you want to pipe data about the host to other services or applications.  
So in essence these checks exist to periodically fetch data about large clusters of servers with the granularity of  
individual computers for things like information dashboards built with Kibana, or service helper software that generate 
opinions/suggestions based on the status of a system or information support technicians usually require.  
There are also more hostinfo checks than regular checks and creating and integrating a hostinfo check is theoretically  
easier than creating and integrating a normal check into the rackspace monitoring ecosystem.  

## Remote API

You can run hostinfos through the rackspace monitoring systems API, remotely. 
You can make a curl request:
```sh
curl -H 'X-Auth-Token: <auth token>' -H 'X-Tenant-Id: <tenant id>'  https://monitoring.api.rackspacecloud.com/v1.0/agents/<agent_id>/host_info/<hostinfo_type>
```
Of course the above method can also be salvaged to programmatically allow usage from a user written script since all it 
does is use the rackspace monitoring API.  
Other rackspace tools which wrap the API like SDKs or CLIs should also theoretically be usable for this scenario.

## Test

To test only the hostinfos you can run the test runner from the root dir with an environment variable like so: 
```sh
TEST_MODULE=HOSTINFO make test
```

## Debugging

You can run the monitoring agent from the command line if you're SSHd into the server and you want to check on the output. 
Great for debugging.
(Caveat: 
  - run these commands with sudo since the agent usually has super user privileges
      when run via the monitoring system
  - The first line ({"Debug":{"InfoType":"<Type>", "OS":"<OS>"}}) is generated by the debug info generating function and will not exist in real output.)
```sh
rackspace-monitoring-agent -e hostinfo_runner -x <hostinfo type>
```
or pipe it through [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) if you have it installed to get prettified colored output. The output is or should be valid json. 
```sh
apt-get install jq
rackspace-monitoring-agent -e hostinfo_runner -x packages | jq .
```
You can also write them to a file instead of command line output:
```
rackspace-monitoring-agent -e hostinfo_runner -x packages -f packages-debug.txt
```
Additionally the API on the box itself has the ability to generate and write debug info to a file for all the hostinfo checks:  
The -a flag runs all of them, -f for a single file, -F for a folder.
E.g: All checks into a folder
```
rackspace-monitoring-agent -e hostinfo_runner -a -F debug
```
E.g.: All hostinfos to a single file:
```
rackspace-monitoring-agent -e hostinfo_runner -a -f debug.txt
```
E.g: Debug info from all the hostinfos as console output
```
rackspace-monitoring-agent -e hostinfo_runner -a
```

Finally the -t flag will print all the possible hostinfo types
```
rackspace-monitoring-agent -e hostinfo_runner -t
```
## Current list of available hostinfo checks

The best resource for figuring out the most up-to-date list of available hostinfos is to look at [all.lua](https://github.com/virgo-agent-toolkit/rackspace-monitoring-agent/blob/master/hostinfo/all.lua)

As of this writing, here is the list: (you can also run the hostinfo_runner with the flags -t -D to generate the following doc segment)

## Notes for developers

PRs are always welcome. Few tips:  
There's currently three over-arching classes of hostinfo checks.  
Those that read files, these use the read function in hostinfo/misc.lua  
Those that spawn shell commands to retrieve data, these use the run function in [hostinfo/misc.lua](https://github.com/virgo-agent-toolkit/rackspace-monitoring-agent/blob/master/hostinfo/misc.lua)  
The last type use a library called [Sigar (System Information Gatherer And Reporter)](https://github.com/hyperic/sigar)  
 which has an invaluable API for efficiently retrieving system information for things like RAM and CPU usage.  
There are some hostinfos that straddle classes as well.  

The hostinfos that use run or read have a streaming interface, with a readStream or childStream being passed to a transform stream which parses and collects data.  
At the moment 100% of the parsers or transform streams have tests.  
The test runner is located in [<root>/tests/test-hostinfo.lua](https://github.com/virgo-agent-toolkit/rackspace-monitoring-agent/blob/master/tests/test-hostinfo.lua)  
with sample inputs and outputs that they're tested against located in [<root>/static/tests/hostinfo](https://github.com/virgo-agent-toolkit/rackspace-monitoring-agent/tree/master/static/tests/hostinfo)  

A common question that arises is why lua?
One of the main reasons behind it is that the [luvit](https://luvit.io/) framework we use allows us to do blazing fast async i/o and offers an API similiar to node, which allows luvit developers to use pre-existing node docs and community questions to their own  
benefit.   
The other reason is that lua is cross platform and works on embedded devices and due to use therein has been optimized to leave a very small footprint, far smaller than node.
